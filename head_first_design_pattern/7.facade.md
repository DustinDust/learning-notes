# The facade pattern

The adapter pattern converts the interface of a class into one that client is expecting, the facade pattern also alters an interface, but for different reason: to simplify the interface.

## The problem

Let's say we have a home theater system, which consist of different component: screen, amplifier, CD player, Popcorn popper, light, projector,...

In order to watch a movie using this system, you have to perform a series of tasks in order

```java
popper.on();
popper.pop();
lights.dim(10);
screen.down();
projector.on();
projector.setInput(dvd);
projector.wideScreenMode();
amp.on();
amp.setDvd(dvd);
amp.setSurroundSound();
amp.setVolume(5);
dvd.on();
dvd.play(movie);
```

And when the movie is over, you have to perform another series of task to turn it off. That's 13 steps to watch, and clean up. The solution for this is to create a Facade.

```java
class HomeTheaterFacade {
  void watch_movie(String movie) {
    // do all the steps above
  }
}
```

## Facade pattern defined

> The Facade pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
