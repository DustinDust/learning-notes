# Code Review Best Practices - Pluralsight

## Why does code review exist?

- Catch bugs early – identifying logical or implementation errors before testing or merging, reducing the cost of fixes.
- Maintain code quality – ensuring code remains clean, maintainable, and follows standards as the software grows.
- Enable mutual learning – both the reviewer and author exchange knowledge, best practices, and experience.
- Align the team – keeping developers synchronized and aware of each other’s work, fostering shared understanding.
- Prevent future issues – encouraging better design and use of existing solutions rather than reinventing the wheel.

## When does code review go wrong?

- Toxic interactions – Unprofessional behavior, arrogance, condescending comments, or personal attacks can turn reviews into confrontational arguments.
- Slowed development – Unnecessary debates, nitpicking, or power struggles during reviews delay progress instead of helping it.
- Lowered morale and fear – Harsh or inconsistent feedback can demotivate developers, create anxiety, and discourage open collaboration.
- Hidden issues and corner‑cutting – Developers may avoid thorough work or hide mistakes to escape negative scrutiny during reviews.
- Increased turnover – Persistent frustration from toxic review experiences can push talented developers to leave the team or company.
